# Hello-World.
Practice repository for the sake of completion.
I'm a student at a liberal arts college, I've heavily enjoyed games throughout my entire life and nearly
went pro instead of going to college but at the last second decided against it due to a few of my friends
in the scene talking about the internal pressures and instabilitity.
